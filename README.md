# Few remarks

According to my experience:

- `hyprlock` was very unreliable so I used `swaylock`
- I removed totally flameshot but I kept the config file. It was totally unreliable. The combination `grim` + `slurp` + `swappy` works perfectly.
- I have a random wallpaper every 4 hours. To do this, I use `wpaperd`. Like it.
- I still have some difficulties to apply Catppuccin themes to Dolphin, as you can see on the Screenshots
- Needs to tune fonts of Dolphin too.
